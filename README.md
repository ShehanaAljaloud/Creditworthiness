# The Business Problem<br>
I work for a small bank and are responsible for determining if customers are creditworthy to give a loan to. my team typically gets 200 loan applications per week and approves them by hand.<br>

Due to a financial scandal that hit a competitive bank last week, I suddenly have an influx of new people applying for loans for my bank instead of the other bank in my city. All of a sudden I have nearly 500 loan applications to process this week!<br>
My manager sees this new influx as a great opportunity and wants me to figure out how to process all of these loan applications within one week.<br>

For this project, I will analyze the business problem using the Problem Solving Framework and provide a list of creditworthy customers to my manager in the next two days.<br><br><br>
# Datasets:

1- Data on all past applications<br>
2- The list of customers that need to be processed in the next few days<br>
